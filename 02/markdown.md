modules in node are for the file's scope only; the can not be gloabl.(private BY DEFAULT). unless you want to export them by another file; kinda like python.

main node files are called app.js .
we call every file a module in node.

in nodejs.org you can go to docs and see the useful packages you want(these packages are already installed in node).

node is the env and express is a package for it's job.
so node is env, javascript is the lan and express is the framework.
